<h3>Factors and Lists</h3>

<p>This week we covered lists and factors which are important types. While factors are fairly straight forward, both conceptually and practically, lists represent a data type that isn't as obvious to understand as are the other data types such as vectors, matrices, and dataframes. Where lists do show up frequently are in the results from various statisical functions that R provides. As our in-class example demonstrated we get back lists from a linear regression or a Chi Square test. This makes sense in many ways since statistical functions need to return a lot of information, (e.g. results, diagnostics, error terms, intermediate computations) all within a single structure. And since lists represent the only type of base R data structure that will accommodate information of differing types, we need to use them in such cases. Just as a reminder, something as simple as this t.test returns a significant amount of information:</p>

<pre>
( myttest = t.test(mtcars$mpg) )

	One Sample t-test

data:  mtcars$mpg
t = 18.8569, df = 31, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 17.91768 22.26357
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 20.09062 

names(myttest)
[1] "statistic"   "parameter"   "p.value"     "conf.int"    "estimate"   
[6] "null.value"  "alternative" "method"      "data.name"   

myttest$p.value
[1] 1.526151e-18

myttest$conf.int

<h3>apply commands</h3>

I mentioned these in the review last week but wanted to dig a little deeper this week. There are a variety of commands in R that have some variation of the word "apply" within their name: apply, tapply, sapply, lapply. These commands, while sharing a similar purpose, exist to operate on different types of data. I readily acknowledge that having these different commands can be confusing, and I cannot provide an explanation as to why there isn't a single integrated apply command that will accommodate different input types. My guess is that they added them over time. There is an addon package called "plyr" which seeks to provide a single interface to manipulating data but you will still need to understand the above commands since you are quite likely to encounter them when reading existing R code. I will attempt to provide a brief summary here of what is going on. As the semester progresses you will see more examples which will help you understand how they work. for now I will summarize apply and sapply.

<h4>apply:</h4>

<p><strong>apply</strong> is used to evalaute a function (built-in or even one that you have written) on the columns or rows of a matrix. It is a substitute for writing a for-loop. So we could do:</p>
<pre>

mymat = matrix(rnorm(25),5,5)
mymat
           [,1]       [,2]         [,3]        [,4]       [,5]
[1,] -0.2535432  0.7927872 -0.297595140  1.06669867 -0.6918667
[2,] -0.9311483  1.5508725 -0.023561964  0.04190551  0.2550659
[3,]  1.1007635 -0.2332405 -0.001881569  0.84589333  1.4851316
[4,]  0.1885696  0.1045578 -1.371205766  0.40117119 -1.3238177
[5,]  0.2006289  1.8323407 -0.911528757 -0.10459268  1.7274098

apply(mymat,1,mean)
[1]  0.1232962  0.1786267  0.6393333 -0.4001450  0.5488516

# This might be more convenient to doing:

resvec = vector()
for (ii in 1:nrow(mymat)) {
     resvec[ii] = mean(mymat[ii,])
}
resvec

# And you can supply your own functions if you wish

mycenterfunc <- function(x) {
   mycenter = x - mean(x)
   return(mycenter)
}

apply(mymat,1,mycenterfunc)
           [,1]       [,2]       [,3]       [,4]       [,5]
[1,] -0.3768393 -1.1097751  0.4614302  0.5887146 -0.3482227
[2,]  0.6694910  1.3722457 -0.8725738  0.5047028  1.2834891
[3,] -0.4208913 -0.2021887 -0.6412148 -0.9710608 -1.4603804
[4,]  0.9434025 -0.1367212  0.2065601  0.8013161 -0.6534443
[5,] -0.8151629  0.0764392  0.8457983 -0.9236727  1.1785582

<hr>
<p>R has some shortcut functions that can also be accomplished with apply although the shortcut functions can be much faster when working on larger matricies. The shortcut functions I'm talking about are rowSums, colSums, rowMeans, and colMeans. So check this out:</p>
<hr>
<pre>
rowSums(mymat) is equivalent to apply(mymat, 1, sum)

rowMeans(mymat) is equivalen to apply(mymat, 1, mean)

colSums(mymat) is equivalent to apply(mymat, 2, sum)

colMeans(mymat) is equivalent to apply(mymat, 2, mean)

</pre>

<hr>
<h3>sapply</h3>

<p>sapply will take vectors or lists as input and attempt to return a "simplified" version, (hence the "s" in the name), of the output which usually means you get back a vector. However, depending on what function you are attempting to apply you could get back a matrix or a list.</p>
<br>
<pre>
sapply(mtcars,class)  # applies the "class" function to each column of the data frame.

      mpg       cyl      disp        hp      drat        wt      qsec        vs 
"numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" 
       am      gear      carb 
"numeric" "numeric" "numeric"  

# the for loop approach would look like:


retvec = vector()                    # Make an empty vector

# Loop through all the columns

for (ii in 1:ncol(mtcars)) {
   retvec[ii] = class(mtcars[,ii])
}
names(retvec) = names(mtcars)
retvec

  mpg       cyl      disp        hp      drat        wt      qsec        vs 
"numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" "numeric" 
       am      gear      carb 
"numeric" "numeric" "numeric" 
</pre>
