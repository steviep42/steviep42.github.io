WORKING WITH VARIABLES

PRACTICE 1.0) AS WE LEARNED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VARIABLE TYPES IN R WITH THE MOST 
FOUNDATIONAL BEING NUMERIC, CHARACTER, FACTOR, DATES, AND LOGICAL. LET'S CHECK SOME OF 
THESE OUT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING WITH THEM. 

CLASSIFY THE FOLLOWING ITEMS AS BINARY, DISCRETE, OR CONTINUOUS. ALSO CLASSIFY THEM 
AS QUALITATIVE (NOMINAL OR ORDINAL) OR QUANTITATIVE. SOME CASES MAY HAVE MORE THAN ONE 
INTERPRETATION 

EXAMPLE: AGE IN YEARS. ANSWER: DISCRETE, QUANTITATIVE, RATIO 

1.	TIME IN TERMS OF AM OR PM. 
2.	BRIGHTNESS AS MEASURED BY A LIGHT METER. 
3.	BRIGHTNESS AS MEASURED BY PEOPLE’S JUDGMENTS. 
4.	ANGLES AS MEASURED IN DEGREES BETWEEN 0◦ AND 360◦


ANSWERS: 1) BINARY, QUALITATIVE, ORDINAL, 2) CONTINUOUS, QUANTITATIVE
3) DISCRETE, QUALITATIVE, ORDINAL, 4) CONTINUOUS, QUANTITATIVE 

1.2) APPLY THE class, typeof, and str COMMANDS TO THE FOLLOWING EXPRESSIONS TO DETERMINE 
THEIR TYPE (E.G. NUMERIC, CHARACTER, DATE, ETC)

	3
	
	class(3)
	
	typeof(3)
	
	my.var = "My name is Steve"
	
	class(my.var)
	
	typeof(my.var)
	
        str(my.var)    # "str" is actually the best one of these functions to use	
	
	current.date = Sys.Date()
	
	class(current.date)
	
	str(current.date)
	
	str(5.45 + 35.67)
	
	str(4 > 5)


1.3) NUMERIC VARIABLES – REMEMBER THAT FOR THE CLASS OF NUMERIC R LET'S COERCE AND 
INTERROGATE BETWEEN INTEGERS AND FLOATING VARIABLES:

	as.integer(5.67)
	
	is.integer(5.67)
	
	is.integer(as.integer(5.67))
	
	str(as.integer(5.67))

1.4) HERE WE CAN TAKE A CHARACTER VALUE AND TURN IT INTO A NUMERIC:

	as.numeric("5.78") + 1

1.5) BUT BE CAREFUL TO DO THE CONVERSION BEFORE YOU TRY TO USE IT IN A CALCULATION:

	"5.78" + 1


PROBLEM 2.0) CHARACTER VARIABLES ARE CREATED BY USING QUOTATION MARKS. THESE TYPES OF 
VARIABLES USUALLY WIND UP BEING LABELS OR FACTORS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS THAT 
WE CAN USE TO GET META INFORMATION:

	my.string = "This is a string"
	
	nchar(my.string)
	
	toupper(my.string)
	
	tolower(toupper(my.string))
	
	strsplit(my.string," ")
	
	paste(my.string, my.string, sep=" : ")
	
	another.string = "Hello my name is Steve"
	
	my.char.var = paste(my.string, another.string, sep = ". ")

2.1) NOTE THAT WE CAN USE THE SUBSTR FUNCTION TO EXTRACT CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STRING. 
THE NEXT COMMAND WILL EXTRACT THE FIRST 10 CHARACTERS. NOTE THAT THE "1" INDICATES THAT 
YOU ARE BEGINNING AT THE 1ST CHARACTER.

	substr(my.char.var, 1, 10)
	
	substr(my.char.var,5 , 5)

3.0) DATES - LET'S CHECK OUT SOME OF THE CAPABILITIES WE HAVE WITH DATES IN R. CAREFULLY 
INSPECT THE OUTPUT FROM THE FOLLOWING EXPRESSIONS:

	Sys.Date()
	 
	Sys.Date() + 10

3.1) WE CAN TAKE CHARACTER VARIABLES AND TURN THEM INTO TRUE DATES BY USING COERCION. 
SO IF WE REPRESENT THE DATE DECEMBER 12TH 2012 AS FOLLOWS (YYYY-MM-DD)

	string = "2012-12-25"
	
	as.Date(string)
	
	class(as.Date(string))


3.2) CHECK THIS EXAMPLE. HERE WE WISH TO COERCE THE DATE MARCH 17TH 1996 INTO A DATE. 
HOWEVER, THE STRING IS MMDDYYYY. 

	as.Date("03/17/1996")  # PRODUCES AN ERROR
	
	as.Date("03/17/1996", format="%m/%d/%Y")


3.3) WE CAN PICK APART THE DATE ONCE WE HAVE IT. THAT IS WE CAN EXTRACT SPECIFIC PARTS 
OF IT:

        my.date = as.Date("03/17/1996", format="%m/%d/%Y")

	format(my.date,"%Y")   
	
	format(my.date,"%b")
	
	format(my.date,"%b %d %Y")

3.4) WE CAN ALSO USE THE SYS.TIME() FUNCTION TO GET BOTH TIME AND DATE:

	Sys.time()
	
	Sys.time() + 20     # Add 20 seconds 
	
	( Sys.time() + 20 ) > Sys.time()
	
3.5) WHEN PROCESSING A SERIES OF DATES FROM AN EXCEL FILE WE CAN RAPIDLY PROCESS THEM 
USING THE STRPTIME COMMAND:

	my.dates = strptime(c("03/27/2003","03/27/2003","04/14/2008","03/27/1958","10/31/206","11/21/2011"),format="%m/%d/%Y")
	
	str(my.dates)
	
	range(my.dates)
	
	my.dates[1] > my.dates[4]

PROBLEM 4) LOGICAL VARIABLES ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ALLOW YOU TO DO COMPARISONS:


	4 > 5
	
	4 < 5
	
	my.var = 4 < 5
	
	my.var

4.1) WE CAN COMBINE THE LOGICAL VARIABLES INTO COMPOUND LOGICAL EXPRESSIONS SUCH 
AS THE FOLLOWING, WHICH USES THE "&" OPERATOR

	my.var = (4 > 5) & ( 4 < 5) 
	
	my.var

# BOTH EXPRESSIONS MUST BE TRUE IN ORDER FOR THE COMBINED EXPRESSION TO BE TRUE.

	my.var = (4 < 5) & (4 < 5)
	
	my.var

4.2) WE COULD ALSO USE THE LOGICAL "OR" OPERATOR "|". IN THIS CASE EITHER EXPRESSION 
COULD BE TRUE AND THE RESULTING COMBINATION WOULD BE TRUE. NOTE THAT (4 > 5) IS FALSE.

	my.var = (4 > 5) | (4 < 5)

WORKING WITH VECTORS

PRACTICE 5.1) NEXT UP WE WILL LOOK AT THE TOPIC OF VECTORS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT 
CONCEPT IN R SO PLEASE MAKE SURE TO WORK THROUGH ALL OF THESE LAB EXERCISES. 

Creating some vectors. This is easy and can be done a number of ways:

        1:10

        rnorm(10)

	y = 5.4     # A single assignment
	
	y = 1:10    # A vector with 10 elements (1 .. 10) 

	y = rnorm(10)  # A vector with 10 values from the Normal distribution
	
	y = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) 


5.2) CREATING A VECTOR TO CONTAIN HEIGHT MEASUREMENTS:

	height = c(59,70,66,72,62,66,60,60)
	
	# LET’S CHECK OUT THE VARIOUS WAYS WE CAN INDEX INTO THE VECTOR
	
	height[1:5]			# Get first 5 elements
	
	height[5:1]			# Get first 5 elements in reverse
	
	height[-1]			# Get all but first element
	
	height[-1:-2]			# Get all but first two elements
	
	height[c(1,5)]			# Get just first and fifth elements
	

5.3) WE CAN APPLY LOGICAL TESTS TO A VECTOR TO FIND ELEMENTS THAT SATISFY A 
CONDITION SET

	height
	
	height == 72		# Test for values equal to 72
	
	height[height == 72]
	
	# SAME AS 
	
	logical.vector = height > 60
	
	height[ logical.vector ]
	

5.4) COMPARISONS CAN BE COMBINED LIKE A DATABASE QUERY:

	height[ height > 60 & height < 70 ] 
	
	# NOTE USE OF THE "&" / AND OPERATOR
	
	height[ height > 60 & height <= 70 ]  
	
	height[ height %% 2 == 0 ]    # Find even numbers


5.5) WE CAN ALSO DO ARITHMETIC ON VECTORS

	weight = c(117,165,139,142,126,151,120,166) 
	
	weight/100
	
	sqrt(weight)
	
	weight^2
	
	sum((weight-mean(weight))^2)/(length(weight)-1)  
	
	# THE VARIANCE FORMULA

	var(weight)

5.6) MORE VECTOR ARITHMETIC. ALSO WE DEMONSTRATE HOW TO APPEND VECTORS

	weights = c(117,165,139,142,126,151,120,166) 
	
	new.weights = weights + 1		# Vector Addition
	
	new.weights
	
	append(weights,new.weights) # Combines the two vectors 
	
	c(weight,new.weights)    # Equivalent to the above


5.7) WE CAN ALSO CREATE CHARACTER VECTORS

	gender = c("F","M","F","M","F","M","F","M")  
	
	smoker = c("N","N","Y","Y","Y","N","N","N")  
	
	table(gender,smoker)	# Let's count them
	
	prop.table(table(gender,smoker))
		  
	library(lattice)
	
	barchart(table(gender,smoker), auto.key=TRUE,
			 main="Smoking M/F")

5.8) NAMING VECTOR ELEMENTS IS AN IMPORTANT WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF INFORMATION.

	height = c(59,70,66,72,62,66,60,60)
	
	new.names = paste("ID",1:8,sep="_")
	
	new.names
	 
	names(height) = new.names
	
	my.names = c("Jacqueline", "Frank" , "Babette",
			   "Mario","Adriana","Esteban","Carole",
			   "Louis")
	
	names(height) = my.names
	
	height
	
	which(height > 60)

	mean(height)  

PRACTICE 6) MISSING VALUES. LET'S GENERATE A VECTOR AND INTRODUCE SOME MISSING VALUES:

	gender = c("F","M","F","M","F","M","F","M")  
	
	length(gender)	 # Gives current length of vector
	
	length(gender) = 10 # Sets length of the vector
	
	gender # The last 2 elements are NA - missing value
	
	is.na(gender)

# WHICH ELEMENTS CONTAIN MISSING VALUES

	which(is.na(gender)) 

# WHICH ELEMENTS DON’T HAVE MISSING VALUES

	which(!is.na(gender)) 

# GET ELEMENTS WHICH AREN'T MISSING

	gender[!is.na(gender)]	 

6.1) EXPLORE SOME OF THE VECTOR FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU:

	mean(height)		# Get the mean	
	
	sd(height)		# Get standard deviation
	
	min(height)		# Get the minimum
	
	range(height)		# Get the range
	
	fivenum(height)		# Tukey's summary 
	
	length(height)		# Vector length
	
	quantile(height)	# Quantiles
	 
	my.vals = rnorm(10000,20,2)   

# CREATE 10,000 VALUES FROM A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION

	max(my.vals)  # Find the maximum value
	
	which.max(my.vals)  # Find which element number it is ?
	
	my.vals[ which.max(my.vals) ]

6.3) HERE IS ANOTHER VECTOR. WHAT IF WE WANTED TO COMPUTE THE SUM OF THE THREE LARGEST 
VALUES ?

	x = c(20,22,4,27,9,7,5,19,9,12)
	
	sort(x)
	 
	rev(sort(x))
	
	rev(sort(x))[1:3]
	
	sum(rev(sort(x))[1:3])


PRACTICE 8.0) THE SAMPLE FUNCTION PROVIDES A WAY TO RANDOMLY EXTRACT SOME NUMBER OF 
ELEMENTS FROM A VECTOR.

LETTERS # A built-in vector with the alphabet

	sample(LETTERS)
	
	sample(LETTERS, replace = TRUE )
	
	sample(LETTERS, 8, replace = FALSE )

8.1) SAMPLING TO SIMULATE A DISTRIBUTION OF COIN TOSSES:

	my.coins = c("Heads","Tails")		# Create a coin vector
	 
	sample(my.coins, 5, replace=TRUE)		# 5 coin tosses

# LET'S SIMULATE 1,000,000 TOSSES AND TABULATE 

	table(sample(my.coins, 1000000, replace=TRUE))
	
	# NOW LET'S CHEAT AND RIG THE COIN
	
	table(sample(my.coins,1000000,replace=TRUE,prob=c(.75,.25)))


PROBLEM 9.0) WORKING WITH CHARACTER VECTORS

	s1 = "I'm a string"
	
	s2 = "I'm a string"
	
	s1; s2
	
	length(s1)
	
	s1 == s2
	
	nchar(s1)
	
	# WE CAN PRINT OUT ITS CONTENTS A CHARACTER AT A TIME. 
	# THIS IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS BUT IS POSSIBLE
	
	for (ii in 1:nchar(my.str)) {
		cat(substr(my.str,ii,ii))
	}

9.1) LET'S LOOK AT A TRUE CHARACTER VECTOR:

	dna = c("A","A","C","G","A","C","C","C","G","G","A","T","G","A","C","T","G","A","A","C")
	
	dna
	
	rev(dna)   # Switch the direction
	
	length(dna)  # Count the characters
	
	# "SHRINK THE VECTOR TO ONE ELEMENT
	
	my.str = paste(dna,collapse="")  
	
	length(my.str) # One element !
	
	my.str
	
	rev(my.str)  # Same as above 
	
	nchar(my.str) # Still shows the correct number of characters

9.2) LET'S EXTRACT SOME CHARACTERS FROM THIS CHARACTER STRING

	substr(my.str,2,8) #Get 8 characters starting at the 2nd
	
	# SET THE 2nd through 8th characters to TTTTTTT
	
	substr(my.str,2,8) = "TTTTTTT"

PRACTICE 10) SEARCHING FOR SUBSTRINGS. WE'LL CREATE A STRING OF SIMULATED DNA:

dna = c("A","A","C","G","A","C","C","C","G","G","A","T","G","A","C","T","G", "A","A","C")

10.1) LOCATE ALL THE G CHARACTERS AND COUNT THEM. DO THE SAME WITH C.

	grep("G",dna)
	
	my.g = length(grep("G", dna))
	
	my.c = length(grep("C",dna))

10.2) LET'S ACCOMPLISH A MORE INVOLVED EXAMPLE

	char.vec = c("here","we","are","now","in","winter")
	
	grep("ar",char.vec)
	
	char.vec[3]
	
	char.vec[ grep("ar",char.vec) ]
	
	grep("zz",char.vec)  # Nothing returned
	
	grep("^w", char.vec)  # Get words starting with "w"
	
	grep("r$", char.vec, value=T) # Get words ending with "r"

        grep("^[h-k]",char.vec,value=T)  # Find words beginning with any of the letters in h,i,j,k

PROBLEM 12) SUBSTITUTING CHARACTERS

	text = c("arm","leg","head","foot","hand","hindleg","elbow")        
	
	gsub("h","H",text)
	
	gsub("o","O",text)
	
	gsub("^.","O",text)


WORKING WITH MATRICES

PRACTICE 13.0) AS WE LEARNED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS TO CREATE A MATRIX.

	myvec = c(1:12)
	
	dim(myvec) = c(3,4)

13.1) WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE DIMENSIONS THAT DON'T "FIT" THE VECTOR ?

	dim(myvec) = c(5,4))  # Will produce an error message
	
	mymat = matrix( c(7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 2), nrow=3, ncol=2) 

13.2) YOU CAN SPECIFY EXPLICITLY THE NROW AND NCOL ARGUMENTS. NOTE ALSO THAT YOU CAN 
REQUEST THAT THE ROWS GET FILLED FIRST AS OPPOSED TO THE COLUMNS:

	mymat = matrix( c(7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 2), nrow=3, 
										 ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)


13.3) WE CAN CREATE A MATRIX BASED ON EXISTING VECTORS:

	a1 = c(4,5,7,9)
	a2 = c(9,1,4,3)
	a3 = c(4,8,6,7)  
	
	mymat = matrix(c(a1,a2,a3),4,3)
	
	mymat

13.4) WE CAN ALSO "DESTROY" OR "UNDO" MATRICES BY USING THE "C" COMMAND TO REMOVE THE 
DIMENSIONS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE:

	dim(mymat)
	
	mymat = c(mymat)
	
	dim(mymat)
	
	mymat

PRACTICE 14.0) WE CAN NAME THE ROWS AND COLUMNS OF A MATRIX, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT 
CAPABILITY

	set.seed(123)
	X = matrix(rpois(9,1.5), nrow=4)

# LET’S SAY THAT THESE REFER TO FOUR TRIALS AND WE WANT TO LABEL THE ROWS “TRIAL.1”, 
# “TRIAL.2”, ETC.

	rownames(X) = paste("Trial",1:nrow(X),sep=".")
	
	rownames(X)
	
	X


14.1) AND WE CAN DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH THE COLUMNS. HERE WE USE "P" AS A PREFIX, 
WHICH IS SHORT FOR "PATIENT"

	colnames(X) = paste("P",1:ncol(X), sep=".")
	
	X
       

14.2) WE CAN ALSO NAME THE COLUMNS SOMETHING MORE SPECIFIC

	drug.names = c("aspirin","paracetamol","nurofen")
	
	colnames(X) = drug.names

14.3) NOW WE CAN BEGIN TO ADDRESS ROWS, COLUMNS, AND ELEMENTS OF THE MATRIX BY USING 
THESE NAMES OR BY USING NUMBERS:

	X['Trial.1',]            # Get all columns 
	
	# GET THE NUROFEN COLUMN FOR TRIAL.1
	
	X['Trial.1','nurofen']   
	
	# GET ALL TRIALS FOR NUROFEN
	
	X[,'nurofen']     
	
	# GET THE NUROFEN COLUMN AND PRESERVES MATRIX STRUCTURE IF DESIRED
	
	X[,'nurofen',drop=FALSE]   
	
	X

14.4) LET'S USE ROW AND COLUMN NUMBERS TO GET ELEMENTS

	set.seed(123)
	
	X = matrix(rpois(9,1.5),nrow=3)
	
	X[2,2]     # Second row, Second Column
	
	diag(X)    # Ah, there is a function that gets the diagonal.
	
	X[1:2,2] # Gets 1st and 2nd rows and 2nd column
	
	X[1:2,]  # Gets 1st and 2nd rows and ALL columns
		 
	X[,c(1,3)] # Get all rows but only columns 1 and 3
     
     
14.5) KEEP IN MIND THAT A MATRIX IS BASICALLY A VECTOR WITH DIMENSIONS SO YOU CAN INDEX 
INTO IT AS IF IT WERE A VECTOR. EXPLAIN THE BEHAVIOR IN THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE. WHAT IS 
IT DOING ?

	set.seed(123)
	
	X = matrix(rpois(9,1.5),nrow=3)
	
	X[1:4]  # What does this do ?
	
	X >= 2   
	
	X[ X >= 2 ]

# THE FOLLOWING RETURNS A LOGICAL EXPRESSION THAT LOCATES ALL EVEN ELEMENTS

	X %% 2 == 0   

# THIS FINDS THE ELEMENT NUMBERS THAT REPRESENT EVEN NUMBERS.

	which(X %% 2 == 0)

# SO THIS WILL PRODUCE THE ACTUAL VALUES OF THE ELEMENTS

	X[X %% 2 == 0 ]

# AS WILL

	X[which(X %% 2 == 0)]
	
# THIS WILL FIND ALL THE ELEMENTS WHERE THE ROW NUMBER IS EQUAL TO THE COLUMN NUMBER

	row(X) == col(X)
	
	X[row(X) == col(X)]


PRACTICE 15.0) IN THIS SECTION WE WILL LOOK AT APPLYING SOME FUNCTIONS TO A MATRIX FOR 
PURPOSES OF SUMMARY.

	set.seed(123) 
	
	X = matrix(rpois(9,1.5),nrow=3)
	
	colnames(X) = c("aspirin","paracetamol","nurofen")
	
	rownames(X) = paste("Trial",1:3,sep=".")
	
	mean(X[,3])  # Mean of the 3rd column
	
	var(X[3,]) # Variance of the 3rd row
	
	rowSums(X)  # Get the sums of all the rows
	
	colSums(X)   # Get the sums of all columns
	
	rowMeans(X)  # Get the means of each row

PRACTICE 16.0) SOMETIMES WE NEED TO ADD ROWS AND COLUMNS TO A MATRIX. THERE ARE TWO 
COMMANDS TO DO THIS: RBIND AND CBIND.

# WILL BIND THE VECTOR (4,7,5) TO X

	rbind(X,Trial.4=c(4,7,5)) 
	
	hold = c(9,4,3,5,4,6,8,7,6)# We have entries for 3 new rows
	
	dim(hold)=c(3,3)               # Make a new matrix
	
	my.mat = rbind(X,hold)         # Bind the old to the new
	
	my.mat                    # What happened to the rownames ?


PRACTICE 16.1) HERE WE USE THE NROW FUNCTION TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF ROWS IN MY.MAT

	rownames(my.mat) = paste("Trial.",1:nrow(my.mat),sep="")
	
	my.mat

PROBLEM 17.0: R SUPPORTS COMMON LINEAR ALGEBRA OPERATIONS ALSO.

	A = matrix(c(1,3,2,2,8,9),3,2)
	
	t(A)
		 
	a = c(5,8)
	
	A %*% a
	
	B = matrix(c(5,8,4,2),2,2)
	
	A %*% B
	
	diag(B)

	# CREATES A MATRIX WITH 1,2,3 ON THE DIAGONAL
	
	diag(c(1,2,3))      

18.1) LET'S SAY WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS. WE CAN ARRIVE AT A SOLUTION 
BY REPRESENTING THEM AS A MATRIX AND SOLVE FOR X IN THE AX = B EQUATION


	A
		 [,1] [,2]
	[1,]    1    3
	[2,]    2    4
	
	b = c(7,10)
	
	x = solve(A) %*% b
	
	x


18.2) CREATING MATRICES TO HOLD THE RESULTS OF SOME BASIC SIMULATIONS. WE CAN CREATE 
MATRICES USING THE REPLICATE COMMAND. THIS APPROACH IS USEFUL IF YOU ARE TRYING TO 
CAPTURE THE RESULTS OF REPEATED SAMPLING ACTIVITY LIKE WHEN BOOTSTRAPPING. 

THIS GENERATES A 4 COLUMN MATRIX WITH 5 ROWS. EACH COLUMN REPRESENTS A SAMPLE OF 5 
VALUES FROM A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION. 

	replicate(4,rnorm(5))

# WHAT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE MULTIPLE SAMPLES FROM A KNOWN DISTRIBUTION ?

	set.seed(177)
	
	some.pop = rnorm(1000)
	
	mean(some.pop)
	
	my.boot = replicate(4, sample(some.pop, 5, replace=T))
