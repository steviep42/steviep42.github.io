<h1>BIOS 545 - Homework #3</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Due by 11:59 PM on 02/23/16. A penalty of 10% per day late applies to submissions 
that arrive after the due date and time. After three days late submissions will no longer 
be accepted and score of 0 will be rendered.</b>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note that your figures do not have to match the exact dimensions depicted here. 
However, the resulting code should generate a readable graphic that is easy to see.
<li>For purposes of this exercise you might find it helpful to work either on a large
display or run R outside of R Studio since the graphics pane can sometimes behave
strangely if it isn't sized correctly. You can always adjust the sizes of the panes within
Rstudio to give the plot window more room. 
</ul>

<h2>Problem 1 (30 points) </h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to plot some information relating to the Indometh data 
set which is provided to you as part of R. You will be writing a function that does a line 
plot of the concentration of Indometacin observed in the blood over time. Each line will 
represent a different subject (and color) thus you will need a legend so users of your 
function can distinguish between the lines. You will also allow users of your function 
to specify a "log"" argument that, if TRUE, would first take the natural logarithm of the 
concentration before making the plot. This helps make the decline in concentrations over 
time more apparent. Note that the log transformation will apply <b>only</b> to the 
concentration - <b>NOT</b> the time.  Users can also supply a vector of colors. The default 
is to use 6 colors from the rainbow palette. A shell for the function, including default 
arguments, would look 
like:</p>

<pre>
plot.indometh <- function(log=FALSE,colors=rainbow(6)) {
   
  # INPUT:      log=FALSE a T/F value. If TRUE then first take the log of the 
  #                       concentration before rendering the plot
  #                  
  #        colors - a vector of valid color values corresponding to the colors to be used 
  #                 for each subject
  
  
       (your code goes here) 
}


</pre>

Here are two ways that your function could be called. Make sure that the y axis accurately 
reflects the value of the log=TRUE argument <b>IF</b> it has been specified. Make sure you have six colors. That 
is, error check the number colors to be sure you have enough to uniquely color each of the
subjects. 

<table>
  <tr><td><pre>plot.indometh()</pre></td><td><pre>plot.indometh(log=TRUE,color=terrain.colors(6))</pre></td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="indometh1.png"></td><td><img src="indometh2.png"></td></tr>
</table>



<p>Here is the help information for the Indometh data set</p>
<pre>
Indometh               package:datasets                R Documentation

Pharmacokinetics of Indomethacin

Description:

     The ‘Indometh’ data frame has 66 rows and 3 columns of data on the
     pharmacokinetics of indometacin (or, older spelling,
     ‘indomethacin’).

Usage:

     Indometh

Format:

     An object of class ‘c("nfnGroupedData", "nfGroupedData",
     "groupedData", "data.frame")’ containing the following columns:

     Subject an ordered factor with containing the subject codes.  The
          ordering is according to increasing maximum response.

<h2>Problem 2a (15 points) </h2>
<p>Please refer to the following plot. Use Base Graphics to construct a replica of 
the graphic. Please provide R expressions that will generate the plot. Explore the 
options and arguments available to you in the boxplot command. You will need to read in 
the Deer data set to be used when creating the graph.</p>

<p>The numbers in red in the top margin are the number of observations in the box plot beneath
it. You can get this information from the the call to the boxplot function itself. Refer
to the lab / lecture for more information.</p>
<p>The color scheme in the boxplot is produced by creating a Color Ramp which in this case
ranges from Green to Blue. Do some research on creating a "Color Ramp" to create a graduated 
color scheme as in the plot. Do *not* pick your colors by hand or hardcode the colors 
yourself.</p>

<h2>Problem 2b (20 points) </h2>
<p>Please refer to the plots below. Use the lattice package to construct replicas
of the graphics. You are plotting the hwy (highway) mileage vs cty (city) mileage for each 
value of the drv (drive) category. You should provide a function named <b>mympg()</b> 
that we can call to reproduce the plots. Here is a shell of the function with 
some default arguments. Note that you should check that the layout makes sense. In other 
words given that there are 10 unique values for the drive variable you should do some 
error checking on the layout vector to insure the layout is possible. For 
example a layout of c(3,7) would not be possible. Legal values would be any wherein the 
product of the two elements is 10. 
</p>

<pre>
mympg <- function(layout=c(2,5),pch=19) {

   # INPUT: layout - a vector that specifies either 2 columns and 5 rows 
   #                 or 5 rows and 2 columns
   #        pch    - a plot character value (See example(pch) ) 
   #
   # OUTPUT: a lattice scatterplot
   
   
   Your code goes here
  
}

# Error check the layout
mympg(layout=c(3,9))
Error in mympg(layout = c(3, 9)) :
  Sorry - the layout numbers must be integers and their product must equal 10

</pre>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>To work this problem correctly look at the various arguments for the lattice commands. 
Download the file as below and read it in using <b>read.csv</b>

Fuel economy data from 1999 and 2008 for 38 popular models of car

Description:

     This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data that the
     EPA makes available on <URL: http://fueleconomy.gov>. It contains
     only models which had a new release every year between 1999 and
     2008 - this was used as a proxy for the popularity of the car.

Format:

     A data frame with 234 rows and 11 variables
        • manufacturer.
        • model.
        • displ. engine displacement, in litres
        • year.
        • cyl. number of cylinders
        • trans. type of transmission
        • drv. f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
        • cty. city miles per gallon
</pre>

<br>
<p>Here are two examples of calling the <b>mympg()</b> function. We should be able to reproduce
these plots using your code and by using the arguments specified in the call to the function.
Note that the overall size does not have to match what you see on this web page. As you develop 
your code it will be displayed in the graphics panel of R Studio which is smaller than what you 
see here. However, the legend title, plot character, and layout should be identical.

<h2>Problem #3 Weather Data Plotting (35 points)</h2>
This one is a bit more challenging but is representative of what you might have to do in an 
actual development setting. If you have been keeping up with the class notes and examples you have
everything you need to know to develop this function relatively easily. Download 
<a href="http://steviep42.bitbucket.org/bios545r_2016/SUPP.DIR/weatherdat.zip">this zip file</a> and unzip it 
somewhere on your hard drive. Make note of where you place it. It contains a folder called "weatherdat" that itself 
contains twelve files corresponding to each month of the year for 2014. These are .csv files named according to the 
convention of <pre>012014.csv, 022014.csv,...,122014.csv</pre> The format of each file is the same although the data values 
will be different. The content relates to weather data for the zipcode 30322, (the Emory zip code), as recorded by
the online weather service <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/">Wunderground</a>. Here are the fields contained 
within each file. The relevant fields for your function are EDT, (the date of the measurement), Mean.TemperatureF, (
the Mean temperature for that given date), and MeanDew.PointF, (the Mean Dew point for that given date).
<pre>
 [1] "EDT"                       "Max.TemperatureF"         
 [3] "Mean.TemperatureF"         "Min.TemperatureF"         
 [5] "Max.Dew.PointF"            "MeanDew.PointF"           
 [7] "Min.DewpointF"             "Max.Humidity"             
 [9] "Mean.Humidity"             "Min.Humidity"             
[11] "Max.Sea.Level.PressureIn"  "Mean.Sea.Level.PressureIn"
[13] "Min.Sea.Level.PressureIn"  "Max.VisibilityMiles"      
[15] "Mean.VisibilityMiles"      "Min.VisibilityMiles"      
[17] "Max.Wind.SpeedMPH"         "Mean.Wind.SpeedMPH"       
[19] "Max.Gust.SpeedMPH"         "PrecipitationIn"          
[21] "CloudCover"                "Events"                   
[23] "WindDirDegrees"            
</pre>

<p>You will be writing a function called <b>weather</b> that will use the .csv files as input. The weather function 
will accept three arguments:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>d1</b> - a character string that indicates a beginning date of the form "YYYY-MM-DD" (e.g. "2014-01-15")
<li><b>d2</b> - a character string that indicates an end date of the form "YYYY-MM-DD" (e.g. "2014-03-31")
<li><b>wd</b> - a character string indicating the folder that contains the .csv weather files
</ol>

It will return the data frame you create that corresponds to the data in the interval specified by d1 and d2. The function
will also create a scatterplot of the Mean.TemperatureF and MeanDew.PointF for the indicated time interval. Use the the color
blue for mean temp and red for Dew point. Label the chart as indicated in the below examples. 

<p>Here are some suggested steps that might help you organize the flow of your function:</p>

<ul>

<li> Validate the d1 and d2 arguments. Make sure they are of valid length - also make sure that d2 is greater than d1 by at least 15 days

<li> In some cases you can treat d1, d2 and EDT, (the date field from the files), as character labels whereas other operations
will require you to treat them as "real" dates
<li> Set the working directory via the "wd" argument. This will be the folder/location wherein you extracted the zip file

<li> Generate a list of the .csv files using the command(s) you learned in Week 1

<li> Loop through the list of .csv file names and read them in using something like read.csv to create a single data frame 
to hold all the information. the <b>rbind</b> function will come in handy
  
<li> Extract data from the data frame relating to the time interval specified by d1 an d2 

<li> Determine the ranges of the Mean Dew Point and Mean Temperature so you can set up your y axis limits correctly. This will 
also help you when you draw the gird lines

<li>Setup a plot window for the scatterplot and suppress the printing of the X axis

<li>Chop up the time interval into six intervals using a function or some looping of your own

<li>Use the axis function to draw the x axis and put up labels

<li>Put margin text in place and draw grid lines

<li>Return the data frame you extracted above
 
</ul>


<p>Your function will label the x axis accordingly. That is, it will flexibly handle ranges of dates. Use
the following two examples as models. You will need to divide the time ranges into 6 intervals. There
is a hard way to do this and an easy way. You already know a function that can help you with this although
you can use whatever method you want. The gird lines <b>MUST</b> match up with the X labels. The horizontal
grid lines must match the examples also. </p>
