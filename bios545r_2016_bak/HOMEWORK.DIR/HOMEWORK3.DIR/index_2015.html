<h1>BIOS 545 - Homework #3</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Due by 11:59 PM on 02/26/15</b>
<li><b>Late penalty of 10% per day applies to late submissions</b>
<li>Note that your figures do not have to match the exact dimensions depicted here. 
However, the resulting code should generate a readable graphic that is easy to see.
<li>For purposes of this exercise you might find it helpful to work either on a large
display or run R outside of R Studio since the graphics pane can sometimes behave
strangely if it isn't sized correctly. You can always adjust the sizes of the panes within
Rstudio to give the plot window more room. 
</ul>

<h2>Problem 1 (30 points) </h2>
<p>Please refer to the following graphic, which represents a single plot composed of
two panels. Use Base Graphics commands (e.g. abline, mtext, text, etc) to construct a replica 
of this graphic. <b>The data source is the infamous mtcars data frame.</b> Create 
a single function, (e.g. mtcarsplot), that I can call, which will produce the plot. Don't
worry so much about matching the exact color of gray used in the legend though pick 
something close. Keep the following in mind: </p>

<ul>
<li>In the first plot we are coloring the data based on where it falls in the quartiles of 
MPG, (the Y axis), whereas in the second plot we are coloring the data relative to weight,
(the X axis). 
<li>The colors used for the data correspond to "black","red","blue", and
"green".
<li>The dashed lines on the graph that indicate the quartiles are intentionally different.
<li>You can use the quantile or fivenum function to obtain the quartile values.
<li>You might find it useful to cut up the MPG and weight variables into intervals to help 
with assigning colors.

<h2>Problem 2a (25 points) </h2>
<p><a href="http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/4d88a2774bd7c84208010000/chart-of-the-day-digital-subscription-prices-march-2011.jpg">Here</a>
is a graphic I want you to reproduce using Base graphics. The image you see below is my reproduction. 
Although these types of charts have dubious value for general statistical analysis or inclusion in research 
papers they do offer opportunities to learn a lot about graphics. Your attempt should be very close to mine or the original. To pick colors accurately consider
using the browser plug in called <a href="http://www.colorzilla.com/">"ColorZilla"</a> that is available for Firefox or Chrome. It has an "eye dropper"
tool that lets you hover over a color and it will tell you the hexadecimal value of the color that you
can then use when you specify colors in R. Windows users can download a standalone application for free that
does this also. It is called <a href="http://instant-eyedropper.com/">Instant Eye Dropper</a>.</p>

<p>Making this plot will be largely a manual process although you should use vectors where possible to 
simplify the construction of the chart. Use any of the high and low level Base graphic functions you want.
Enclose all statements necessary to create this plot in a function called "chart". It doesn't need to have
any arguments. We should be able to call it and it will produce the graphic as indicated below.</p>

<p>You will most definitely need to dig into the help pages for functions like mtext, segments, axis, etc 
and conduct some experiments to get things looking right. Refer to my reproduction and you will see that 
the grid lines do not overlay the bars in the plot. That is they are behind the bars. Your version
should be like this also. </p>

<h2>Problem 2b (10 points) </h2>
Please refer to the graphic below. Use lattice graphics to construct a replica of 
the graphic. You can provide either a function or standalone commands. However,
your code must be self contained. That is, I have to be able to run it (of course). 
Note that we are plotting the Diamond Price vs. the carat size and 
conditioning that by Diamond Color (D,E,F,G,H,I,J), which produces the seven panels.
Note that Diamond Colors here are refereed to by letters as opposed to color names.
Furthermore we are looking at the group interaction of Diamond Quality, which is 
represented in the panels and legend by five different colors. </p>

<p>To work this problem correctly look at the various arguments for the lattice commands. 
Look at the lecture examples for lattice. There is more than one 
way to get the plot as desired but these arguements will help you. Note also that you 
should let xyplot select the colors for you. You should not have to specify colors by 
hand in any way. lattice will "give" you most ,if not all, of what you need so if you
find yourself working too hard to get the graphic then you are not using the power of 
the lattice package.</p>

<h2>Problem #3 Weather Data Plotting (35 points)</h2>
This one is a bit more challenging but is representative of what you might have to do in an 
actual development setting. If you have been keeping up with the class notes and examples you have
everything you need to know to develop this function relatively easily. Download <a href="http://steviep42.bitbucket.org/bios545r/SUPP.DIR/weatherdat.zip">this zip file</a> and unzip it 
somewhere on your hard drive. Make note of where you place it. It contains a folder called "weatherdat" that itself 
contains twelve files corresponding to each month of the year for 2014. These are .csv files named according to the 
convention of <pre>012014.csv, 022014.csv,...,122014.csv</pre> The format of each file is the same although the data values 
will be different. The content relates to weather data for the zipcode 30322, (the Emory zip code), as recorded by
the online weather service <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/">Wunderground</a>. Here are the fields contained 
within each file. The relevant fields for your function are EDT, (the date of the measurement), Mean.TemperatureF, (
the Mean temperature for that given date), and MeanDew.PointF, (the Mean Dew point for that given date).
<pre>
 [1] "EDT"                       "Max.TemperatureF"         
 [3] "Mean.TemperatureF"         "Min.TemperatureF"         
 [5] "Max.Dew.PointF"            "MeanDew.PointF"           
 [7] "Min.DewpointF"             "Max.Humidity"             
 [9] "Mean.Humidity"             "Min.Humidity"             
[11] "Max.Sea.Level.PressureIn"  "Mean.Sea.Level.PressureIn"
[13] "Min.Sea.Level.PressureIn"  "Max.VisibilityMiles"      
[15] "Mean.VisibilityMiles"      "Min.VisibilityMiles"      
[17] "Max.Wind.SpeedMPH"         "Mean.Wind.SpeedMPH"       
[19] "Max.Gust.SpeedMPH"         "PrecipitationIn"          
[21] "CloudCover"                "Events"                   
[23] "WindDirDegrees"            
</pre>

<p>You will be writing a function called <b>weather</b> that will use the .csv files as input. The weather function 
will accept three arguments:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>d1</b> - a character string that indicates a beginning date of the form "YYYY-MM-DD" (e.g. "2014-01-15")
<li><b>d2</b> - a character string that indicates an end date of the form "YYYY-MM-DD" (e.g. "2014-03-31")
<li><b>wd</b> - a character string indicating the folder that contains the .csv weather files
</ol>

It will return the data frame you create that corresponds to the data in the interval specified by d1 and d2. The function
will also create a scatterplot of the Mean.TemperatureF and MeanDew.PointF for the indicated time interval. Use the the color
blue for mean temp and red for Dew point. Label the chart as indicated in the below examples. 

<p>Here are some suggested steps that might help you organize the flow of your function:</p>

<ul>

<li> Validate the d1 and d2 arguments. Make sure they are of valid length - also make sure that d2 is greater than d1 by at least 15 days

<li> In some cases you can treat d1, d2 and EDT, (the date field from the files), as character labels whereas other operations
will require you to treat them as "real" dates
<li> Set the working directory to the "wd" arguments

<li> Generate a list of the .csv files using the command(s) you learned in Week 1

<li> Loop through the list of .csv file names and read them in using something like read.csv to create a single data frame to hold all the information
  
<li> Extract data from the data frame relating to the time interval specified by d1 an d2 

<li> Determine the ranges of the Mean Dew Point and Mean Temperature so you can set up your y axis limits correctly. This will 
also help you when you draw the gird lines

<li>Setup a plot window for the scatterplot and suppress the printing of the X axis

<li>Chop up the time interval into six intervals using a function or some looping of your own

<li>Use the axis function to draw the x axis and put up labels

<li>Put margin text in place and draw grid lines

<li>Return the data frame you extracted above
 
</ul>


<p>Your function will label the x axis accordingly. That is, it will flexibly handle ranges of dates. Use
the following two examples as models. You will need to divide the time ranges into 6 intervals. There
is a hard way to do this and an easy way. You already know a function that can help you with this although
you can use whatever method you want. The gird lines <b>MUST</b> match up with the X labels. The horizontal
grid lines must match the examples also. </p>
